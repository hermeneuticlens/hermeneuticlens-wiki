    -   AAR 2020: re-reading Song of Songs in the context of Christian-Jewish relations. The Song book is actually a collection of multiple songs. This multiplicitity can be theologically constructive -> religious pluarlism. Based on Elizabeth Clarks: Origin's Song of Songs serves as a commentary on Romans 9-11. God's relationship is one of multiciplicity, capable of embracing God-Israel, Christ-Church, etc.

    -   AAR 2020: rabbinic creative exegesis, especially regarding difficult passages, as a hermeneutics of hope. Hermeneutical creativity is not simply a technique. There is virtue and theological meaning behind such creativity. the (interdependent?) relationship between hope and despair.
