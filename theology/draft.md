====== Covenant: A Thematic Outline ======

===== Covenant in Judaism =====

==== Why Covenant? ====

  * **Why is "covenant" a special and significant concept in Judaism?** \\ "Covenant" is unique in both its inclusiveness of various kinds of subject matters in Judaism and its unique perspective of emphasizing relationality as a religious reality, even a mystery. "Covenant" encompasses all relationships: God-human, human-human, human-creation, etc. "Covenant" recognize the technical details and fine complexities of these relationships, while attempting to remind us of the transcending reality behind them.
  * **Does "covenant" necessarily stand above other concepts in the Bible / in Judaism?** \\ No. Even though covenant is a central concept, every concept will serve as a hermeneutical perspective that shed lights on the subject matter in a unique way. The dialogue between these concepts are not necessarily hierarchical.
==== Covenant as Relationship ====

  * Covenantal relationship vs other kinds of relationship
  * Is covenant more than just "relationship"?
  * religious interpretation vs humanistic (secular?) interpretation

==== Universality and Particularity ====

  * The relationship between God's universal covenant with humanity as a whole and God's particular covenant with the Jewish people (or any group of non-Jews).
  * The relationship between the entire community and the individuals that are singled out for the sake of the entire community.
      * What can Christians learn from Judaism regarding the calls of Abraham, Joseph, Moses, Elijah, etc. in order to understand that God's call of Jesus is not diametrically opposed to the Jewish people?
  * Covenant as a basis for Jewish theology of religions / comparative theology?
  * Should only particular relationship be regarded as covenant (i.e. in contrast with universal values and norms that do not require covenantal relations), or should what is universal to human beings also be considered as God's covenant?
      * Covenant is always both universal and particular. It is a mistake to identify the covenantal relationship only with the particular and exclusive, as tempting as it might be.
  * U-P as an **existential dialectic**, history of Jewish existential philosophy (and its non-Jewish counterparts?)
      * U-P existential dialectic as **mystical**, universality as experienced **apophatically**  as its absence through the presence of particularities.

==== Subject and Object ====

  * Covenantal Epistemology: what does it mean to know? To know objectively and to know subjectively? To rationalize and to intuit? To know means to be able to relate to, to understand not just from an outsider perspective, but also to be impartial and just, i.e. not "subjective." Can the idea of the covenant help us understand the relationship between these two seemingly conflicting aspect in epistemology?

====== Key Issues on Covenantal Theology ======

how Jews and Christians define "remnant" differently? Christian is more exclusive and polemical. Jews, a great deal of diversity from the Essenes to the Hasids.


===== Covenant in Judaism =====

==== Definition of Covenant ====

Covenant is a key concept in Judaism and Christianity, and for both religions (though in their own particular way) the term reflects divine-human relationship on the universal level, and thus applies to people outside of their religious communities. While "covenant" is a fundamental and seemingly all-encompassing concept, it is also very specific, because it deals with a particular aspect of the divine-human relationship, namely how God communicates with humans the "divine will" or "holy way" and how humans (should) respond to it. For Christian-Jewish relations, this terms is particularly significant due to centuries of supersessionism and its deleterious impact on Christian theologies, spiritualities, and cultures.

==== Unilateral or Bilateral ====

...

==== Universality and Particularity ====

... to be added, regarding articles by Jon Levenson.

==== Continuity ====

  * In many Christian theologies, God's covenant with the Jewish people is seen as temporary (regardless of the covenant is unilateral or bilateral, universal or particular). The main arguments are that, in principle, the Law cannot be perfectly fulfilled by normal human being, and that, historically, the Jewish people have failed to fulfill the covenant, such as  the destruction of the Temple. According to these arguments, the curse of the law is meant to be carried and thus atoned by Christ. Even if the Jewish people can have a covenantal relationship with God, the covenant is meant to be fulfilled by Christ from the very start.<sup>[[http://www.hermeneuticlens.com/wiki/index.php?title=Key_Issues_on_Covenantal_Theology#cite_note-1|[1]]]</sup>
  * In Judaism, in contrast ...

==== Covenant and Liturgy/Temple ====

  * Scholars such as Scott W. Hahn have argued that Christianity and Judaism, including their scriptural canons, are fundamentally established on liturgy / liturgical understanding of the divine-human relationship.<sup>[[http://www.hermeneuticlens.com/wiki/index.php?title=Key_Issues_on_Covenantal_Theology#cite_note-2|[2]]]</sup> However, such an argument allows the supersessionist argument that the Old Covenant is abolished and superseded due to the destruction of the Temple, i.e. no matter how holy Jews try to be, they are not able to maintain the covenantal relationship because God deems them as not pure or qualified for divine worship. In reality, on the contrary, Judaism has many aspects of understanding of its continuity, and Temple is not the sole determining factor.
  * What is the relationship between Temple as the place of sacrifice and Temple as God's dwelling place on earth? Would it make sense in Judaism to say that the latter can exist without the former? Or are they inseparable?
  * Has the destruction of the Temple radically changed the Jewish conception of the covenant or simply enriched it? To what extent are hopes and despairs expressed? To what extent can we learn about the Jewish reaction to the loss of the Second Temple by taking cues from the ancient Israelites' reaction to the loss of the First Temple?

==== Covenant and Sacrifice ====

Some Jews (such as Maimonides) trivialize animal sacrifice in terms of its theological importance with regard to the covenant. Maimonides cites Psalm 50, which many Christians cite to also trivialize animal sacrifice. Should the animal sacrifice be infinitely trivialized as no more than what happened in the past? Or does it have any long-lasting theological impact? In particular, how do Christians who trivialize animal sacrifices also see animal sacrifices as a foreshadowing of Christ's own sacrifice and an indication of its efficacy? (See Nachmanides's and J.B. Soloveitchik's responses.)

===== Covenant in New Testament =====

What are the languages (especially verbs) used to describe "covenant"?

Hebrews 8:7, 9, 13

Galatians 4:24

[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3&version=NRSV|Galatians 3:18]]: covenant is fundamentally promise, an inheritance that does not "come from the law." Law points to faith, but covenant is not law, it is promise, containing both law and faith.

Matthew 5:13 Jesus calls his disciples the "salt of the earth" → "covenant of salt" in Numbers 18:19, 2 Chronicles 3:5. See also [[https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Numbers.18.19.2-3|Rashi on Numbers 18:19]], [[https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Leviticus.2.13.1|Rashi on Leviticus 2:13]], [[https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Leviticus.2.13.1|Ramban on Leviticus 2:13]], [[https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.19b.14|Menachot 19b]].

===== Comparative Theology and Christian Theology =====

Christian Theology as the foundation that makes comparative theology possible, aka the "condition" for comparative theology. In other words, comaprative theology is not something foreign to Christian theology but a organic Christian expression of Christian worldview. This is why Christian comparative theology must be motivated by Christian virtue and rooted in Christian perspective.

===== Relationship between Comparative Theology and Scriptural Reasoning =====
