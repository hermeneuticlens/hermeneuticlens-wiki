What does it mean for God to _remember_ the covenants of Abraham, Isaac, etc.?
- from the original linguistic context?
- can it be philosophically understood?
- to what extent does God remembering and human remembering similar/different? Does God's rememberign speak of how humans should remember? Are God in the same religious/existential situation as humans?

-   What does it mean for God to hear our prayers? Even when post-Holocaust Jewish thinker concluded that God cannot intervene history directly and, except historical revelations, can only rely on human free will to do so?

# Covenant and Marriage.

-   For David Novak, the covenant "is a lot like a contract, yet it also requires a shared universe of meaning in order to be enacted."^[@tulingItBindingCovenant2020, 304.] This is like marriage, which also is contractual but whose meaning varies depending on the cultural/social context/universe.
-   In Novak's view, Noahide and Mosaic covenants are together the basis of all covenantal relationships; together as a pair, they shed light on all forms of divine-human and human-human relationship.^[@tulingItBindingCovenant2020, 305.]
