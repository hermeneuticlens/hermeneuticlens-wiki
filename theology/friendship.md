# Friendship

## Friendship quotes
-   “In this world, two things are essential: life and friendship. Both should be highly prized, and we must not undervalue them. Life and friendship are nature’s gifts. [Sermon Denis 16,1]- St. Augustine
-   St. Francis de Sales wrote: “Friends are for our growth in health, happiness, and holiness on this earth in order to better prepare us to share together the gift of eternal life in heaven.”
-   “Real friends enjoy one another’s company. Real friends play together and help one another. Real friends make scheduling and financial sacrifices so they can spend time together. Real friends talk openly and respectfully about deep matters of the heart. They share their convictions about faith and family and politics, eager to learn and persuade all at once. And real friends do all this with an abiding confidence that their friendship is bigger than their differences and that love (a commitment to pursue good for someone) covers a multitude of sins and disagreements.” https://lentsblog.org/2020/08/27/on-real-and-apparent-friendships/

## Elements
-   Solid foundation (honesty, openness, etc.), clear and meaningful purpose, commiseration/support, and growing together.

## Friendship and Academia

-   Friendship is seeking commonality and reciprocity across differences/particularities. This is the best way to address fragmentation, isolation, and clique culture, as well as humanizing the academia in general.
