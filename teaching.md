# My ideas for pedagogy/collegiality in general
## Incentive for learning theology
Studying theology may not be an appealing proposition for many students. Therefore, it would be helpful to clarify the course objectives and make them more appealing, such as emphasizing more on the skills that students will improve that are relevant to their lives/careers: critical thinking, collaboration/leadership, knowledge management, research, dialogue, storytelling, etc. It would also be helpful to invite students to share their skills and bring them into the classroom, without comrpomising or distracting form the need to learn how to read religious texts and understand religious interpretations.

# Some ideas for my course
## Jewish-Christian comparisons
- Eschatology. Aquinas: people will continue learning about God, which is inexhuasible mystery. Judaism: continued learning of Torah in the world to come.
