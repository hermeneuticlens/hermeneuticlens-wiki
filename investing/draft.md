Fidelity is my brokerage, because of its

Zero commission fees on stocks, ETFs, and options ($0.65 per options contract)
Abundant education articles, webinars, and tools (see below)
Free Bloomberg News (via the Fidelity mobile app)
Active Trader Pro software
Private community forum
Knowledgable and friendly customer service representatives
Free TurboTax Premier for qualifying customers
Security features, including two-factor authentication and freeze on outgoing money transfers
But Fidelity is not without its problems:

Outdated user interfaces: website looks tired and performs slowly. They have been trying to update it bit by bit, but there are a lot of inconsistencies. Same thing with Active Trader Pro. Great features; not so great user interface.
Much fewer features on option trading than competitors (such as thinkorswim).
Most of the webinars are not recorded. So, you cannot benefit from them if your schedule does not allow live attendance.
In any case, here are the tools offered by them

Life lessons through Investing
Respect the reality. Be willing to observe and learn. Don't make up excuses. It is easy for us to make up excuses in everyday life to get through things, but the market will not tolerate BS.
Do not be idealistic or perfectionist. Do not try to anticipate catching or regret missing “the one chance.” The harder you try, the bigger you lose on one bad experience. Be willing do the small and humble work and pace yourself, and accept small losses and gains every day. Focus on learning, not FOMO.
Do not try to hold on a losing trade, thinking that the price may come back to your favor. It is much better to exit a losing trade early and start the next one on a more proper footing.
Invest small. DO NOT GAMBLE. DO NOT BE GREEDY. It sounds as though market is the place where everyone gets greedy. It is really not. You can earn money reliably only if you have the knowledge, experience, and the willingness to do what is right, just like other things in life. You can have large positions only when you know exactly what you are doing (for example, you have 90% or more certainty, and you are okay with the potential loss).
Take care of your health and well-being. If you are too anxious, the second-to-second fluctuations of the stock market will harm you badly. Using an investment strategy that focuses on the mid-term (a few days to a few weeks) will help you manage the anxiety and enrich your life as a whole. Investment should enrich and complement your life, not consume it. You can choose not to invest when the market is bad or uncertain; you can choose to invest in mutual funds or ETFs; or, you can choose some downside protection strategies, such as options.
Best practices for me
1. A combination of option strategies: writing covered calls and puts. My preference is to sell them deep out-of-the-money (OTM) so that you have the opportunity to close the option trade when the price goes against your favor. A deep out-of-the-money option will provide a safe buffer zone before the option expires, and it tends to have loewr delta, which means that your loss will be much smaller than your loss with an option sold nearer-the-money in case the price moves against your favor.

2. Pick the right stocks and hold, based on sector rotations. Use call and put options if the downside is less predictable. Unless the stock price may fall 10% or more, hold the stock as long as possible for long-term capital gain tax qualification.

3. Swing/Momentum Trade: don't fight agains the market; follow it, even if you may not understand why the market behaves in a certain way.

4. Use limit order for making a trade. Using trailing stop loss order for exiting a trade, or use stop loss order if you cannot keep a close eye on it. The point is to reduce the probability and amount of loss, so that there is more possibility for you to gain.

5. Pay attention to market sentiment. Play CNBC or Bloomberg in the background as you watch the market technically. Still, sometimes market behaves contradictory to or absent of any apparent reason. And, news can be minutes late after the market has already reacted to it; so use technical analysis to protect your positions.
