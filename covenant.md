What does it mean for God to _remember_ the covenants of Abraham, Isaac, etc.?
- from the original linguistic context?
- can it be philosophically understood?
- to what extent does God remembering and human remembering similar/different? Does God's rememberign speak of how humans should remember? Are God in the same religious/existential situation as humans?
