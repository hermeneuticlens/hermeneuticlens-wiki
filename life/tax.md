# Starting My Own Business

## My scenario / needs
-   Photography and (maybe) videography for others 
-   Investing? Is it necessary? Investing for others, not just myself?

## Basic things to consider
-   Corporation vs Partnership: https://www.fundera.com/blog/partnership-vs-corporation
    -   My choice would be S-Corp: No personal liability + Pass-Through taxation.
